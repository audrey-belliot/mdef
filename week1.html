        <h2>BOOTCAMP 4th to 8th October 2021</h2>
        <p>

          After one month in Barcelona and now three weeks at IaaC it feels like so many things are already happening. In the city, in Poblenou, at IaaC, everywhere!<br>

          I started with 2 weeks of pre-course —> just a few words to describe later : Arduino, electricity basics, digital fabrication, 3D modelling (Rhino, Fusion, Fusion Slicer), Communication class, lamp challenge :), metal welding / add pictures

          Very intensive two weeks as I was not familiar at all with digital fabrication. It makes me want to learn more about all these new softwares and machines
        </p>
