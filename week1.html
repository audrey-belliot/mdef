          <h3>week reflections</h3>
        <p>After one month in Barcelona and now three weeks at IaaC it feels like so many things are already happening. In the city, in Poblenou, at IaaC, everywhere.<br/><br/>

          I started with 2 weeks of pre-course : electricity basics, Arduino programming, digital fabrication, 3D modelling softwares (Rhino, Fusion, Fusion Slicer), communication class, lamp challenge :), metal welding <br>
          // add pictures<br>
          Very intensive two weeks as I was not familiar at all with digital fabrication. It makes me want to learn more about all these new softwares and machines.</br>

          First week : visiting elisava, understanding the program of the year, meeting with the faculty team,<br>
          Designing from a first person perspective<br/>


          git add git commit git push

          <h3>who am I?</h3>
          <p>Skills, knowledge, attitude - Who we want to be.<br>

          Super useful exercice, it makes me think that we should start thinking about that much earlier in our studies. It could be so useful even before starting studies to help figure out where we want to go.

          <h3>meeting poblenou</h3>
          <p>We just finished our first MDEF week with a tour of Poblenou with Chiara. <br/>

          - BiciHub : I went before actually as I was looking for a self repair shop to fix my bike.<br/>
          - Trash Lab (it is actually a different name but they work with trash to make stuff)<br/>
          - Plataforma : art gallery, the owner started a project Poblenou Urban District with many other cultural places in the barrio <br/>
          - and the last one that I really enjoyed : the name was until now ConnectHort but it become BIOMA (a mix between Biom and Mamma). Besides growing food, they have many different projects including cultural projects, they organize festivals, host concerts, have a sustainable architecture experimentation... Every Saturday morning is dedicated to volunteering so I will go check it out next week!<br/>
