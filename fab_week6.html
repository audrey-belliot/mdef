This week class was about Electronic Design, the class content can be found <a href="https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/fabacademy-local-docs/material/week06/">here</a>.
<br>For this week assignment I am going to make a PCB for my ESP32 Huzzah board for sensors to measure temperature so I can use it to check the performance of the low tech experiments we are making (solar oven and fireless cooker).

<br><br>We have two types of temperature sensors at the fablab : NTC and RTD. I am going to use a NTC thermistor (Negative Temperature Coefficient Thermistor - they are thermally sensitive resistors and have are decreasing in resistance as temperature increases).

<br><br>The circuit I want to make should have 2 thermometers and 2 RGB LEDs that will change color depending on the temperature.
<ul>
<li>One to measure the temperature inside the solar oven</li>
<li>The second one to measure the outside temperature</li>
</ul>

<h3>prototype on breadboard</h3>

I started to test the termistor wiring on my breadboard with the ESP32 microcontroller. I used a few online tutorials to find out the right wiring.

NTC thermistors need to be wired with a resistor to make a voltage divider. NTC resistance decreases as the temperature rises. The Steinhart-Hart equation enables to use this data to derive temperature.

<br>I used the following library to calculate and display the temperature on my monitor. <a href="https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/thermistor">Link to the library</a>

<br><br>I then added some code to change the color of the LED when the temperature is over 20°C. I will use different limits when it will be for the oven but here it was just to try it.

          <h3>schematic</h3>

          Once the prototype on the breadboard was working, I made the schematic of the wiring on Kicad. We had downloaded before the librairies of components available at FabLab BCN.

          <br><br>I duplicated the combination “voltage divider : thermistor + resistor” to have one for the oven and one for the exterior.
          As the thermistor for the oven would need to be placed inside without putting the whole board in the oven, I changed one of the thermistor for a two pins connector so I will then be able to attach a thermistor to a longer cable that can be placed in the oven.

          <br><br>To make it visually clear, I grouped the connexions into frames (oven sensor, exterior sensor, jumper) and added labels on each wire to represent the connexions between the elements and the micro-controller pins.

          <br><br>The next step is to generate the netlist from the schematic. Then open the netlist in PCB layout editor on Kicad.

        <h3>physical layout</h3>

        Once I am on the layout editor, the component have connexions that has been automatically generated from the schematic but I need to place them on the board shield to have the most simple circuit possible and avoid circuits to cross.

        Some people even do “PCB art”, use patterns etc...

        <br><br>After moving the components everywhere, I finally found a way to minimize the length of the connexion circuits. I still had two circuits that were crossing so I went back to the schematics and added a resistor that will be 0 ohm to make a jumper as I couldn’t avoid some of the lines to cross.

        At the end, I created the lines of the outside of the shield and exported it.

        <h3>prepare for milling</h3>

        Last step before milling is to prepare the files. I opened the PCB layout from Kicad in Inkscape and separated it into 3 files that have different setup for milling: the holes, the circuit and the outline.

        <br><br>It is important to save them with 1000 ppp quality and use custom export to always keep the same size.

        <br><br>When the files were ready, I used MODS to enter the parameters needed for every file, then I saved them to be able to open them with the program of the milling machine.



        <h3>milling</h3>

        <em>Note: This part is also related to a previous week class “Electronic production”.</em>

        <br><br>Here are the steps I followed:
        <ul>
        <li>Tape the PCB with double sided tape</li>
        <li>Open Vpanel for SRM-20</li>
        <li>Place the endmill 1/64 to cut the traces first (be very careful not to make it fall as it is super fragile)</li>
        <li>Place the endmill at the bottom left corner of the board with x and y, then lower the z</li>
        <li>Let endmill “fall” on the board (using the finger to go slow) and screw again</li>
        <li>Set Origin Poin XY and Z</li>
        <li>Press Cut on the program and select the right file</li>
      </ul>
