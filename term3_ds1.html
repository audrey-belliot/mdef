            <h3>reflections</h3>

            For this term we are continuing working on Slow Lab with Gerda and now also with Paula who is joining us as she was also interested in promoting regenerative ways of living.
            <br>During our research of similar initiatives in Catalunya, we found the website <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/">Low Tech Magazine</a> which has been really inspiring for us. The author Kris De Decker is a journalist and for the last 15 years has been analyzing past technologies that could be used in today’s society. He also built a solar version of his website hosted on a server powered by a solar panel. As he is based in Catalunya we met recently for the first time and found many possibilities for collaboration. He has been working a lot on theory and at individual scale so he was telling that it would make sense for him to bring it to a wider audience and to different contexts so we discussed about events we could do together.
          We would also like to see what design and digital fabrication could bring to his existing artefacts to rethink and make them desirable to a different audience.

<br>From the 5th to 15th of May it is <a href="https://www.model.barcelona/ca">MODEL Festival d'Arquitectures</a> in Barcelona and BaM (BioArquitectura Mediterranea) is hosting a few events in ConnectHort. We will participate and invited Kris De Decker to co-host the event with us.
The event will be a solar brunch, we described it as follow for the invitation:
<br><br>
<em><strong>Join a solar brunch!</strong>
<br>At the intersection between the slow movement and low-techs, we want to bring awareness and promote a resilient lifestyle. We want to open conversations around how to integrate ancient techniques into our present context.
This event will be focused on ways to be less dependent on energy and promote the use of solar energy in a fun way: solar cooked food, solar powered music, solar fun.

<br><br>Note: As everything is powered by the sun, in case of bad weather, the activities of the event could change and focus on showcasing low-tech devices in general and have an open conversation around how to integrate these techniques to today’s context. With pica-pica!
</em>

<br><br>Concerning logistics, we still need to finalize the new oven this week at IAAC, we will go buy speakers and amplifier for the solar music and Kris is going to bring a 50w 12v solar panel to power it.
<br>We are looking for recipes that can be cooked at a "low" temperature as so far we reach around 100°C with the oven prototypes we have.
