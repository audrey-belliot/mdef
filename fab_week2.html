<br><br>This second week was about computer-aided design (<a href="https://fablabbcn-projects.gitlab.io/learning/fabacademy-local-docs/material/week02/">class content here</a>). During the local class we had a first part on different concepts: 2D modelling, 3D modelling, raster vs vector, parametric design, generative design... and a second part of the class that was more a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@vico/S1bQ_yL_x ">focus on Blender</a>.

<br><br>Even if we were introduced to Rhino and Fusion 360 during Precourse, this is still all very new to me. I never did any 2D/3D modelling in my practice so for this week's task of creating a 3D model related to my research, it is going to require a lot of tutorials!

<br><br>After hesitating in the choice of the tool between Fusion 360 and Blender, I decided to go with Fusion 360 that I can use with an education licence and that can be used for parametric design. I am still curious about the immense possibilities of blender and all its open source approach and community so I will definitely try it next time.

<br><br>My research is about low techs and I experimented the fireless cooker technique. It consists of heating a container and when the content is boiling, moving it to a box insulated with covers or other non conductive materials for it to continue coooking without the use of electricity/gaz/fire.

There are different ways to do it but it could be a box dedicated to it that would fit in peopleâ€™s kitchens and adapt to the size of the pots they use.

<br><br>I found a few online tutorials to create boxes on Fusion 360 and decided to start with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT_FH3lL-3A">this one</a> as it included joints and can create a model that could later be laser cut.

<br><br>I added the cooker that I made with two different elements (for the pot and lid) and then the yellow "cushion" inside the box to surround the cooker.
<br><br>Most of the dimensions are set with parameters, I made association between values so when we change the size of the cooker, the cushion and box adapt their sizes too.
<br><br>After that, putting it in context seemed too much so I tried to search for an already made kitchen 3D model to import. But it ended up super complicated for me! So after seeing some tutorials that created kitchens or other environment with simple shapes and extrusions I decided to add just some minimalist furniture around the box to put it in context without creating a full kitchen.
And here are the <strong>first renderings of my life!</strong>
