            <h3>towards more radicality.</h3>

             Last design studio Mariana share with us a presentation about radicality as well as questions for radical scenario making.

            <br>This was quite useful and I particularly like one of the first definitions of radicality as something “Arising from or going to a root or source; basic” because this is part of the vision we have for the slow lab.

            <h3>Designing with others - finding a community of practice</h3>

            These last two weeks, I continued working on the slow lab idea with Gerda. We are now in a step where we want to go further in the experiementations we started (fireless cooking, solar oven and aquaponics) but we also want to extend these experimentations with others.

          <br><br>“Others” could be both:
          <ul>
          <li>people who don’t necessarily know about low techs but would be willing to experiment with us so we can compare our experience and have a broader impact (it could be a community of neighbors for example)</li>
          <li>people who have an expertise in these topics and have already successfully started this kind of projects</li>
        </ul>

            We have started to identify people involved in this kind of projects:
            <ul>
            <li>we are now talking to Low-tech Lab in France and joined their discussion platform on Discord so we can discuss with other that have been in the same process,</li>
            <li>we are starting to discuss with a German person that is starting a low-tech community in Spain</li>
            <li>we went to Can Masdeu which is an house in Collserola park that has been occupied by a group of environmental activist now running some agroecology, permaculture, self-sufficiency experimentations. This is at least what we understood before going but we found out that the weekly visit announced on their website actually doesn’t happen anymore since covid and will start again at the end of March. So we will try again!</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>improving our existing prototypes</h3>
          We are starting V2 of the solar oven.

            <h3>measuring - data collection</h3>

            I bought a second hand consumption meter to have better idea of how much energy is saved when using low tech cooking appliances. I became quite obsessed with it and I am now measuring everything in my appartment.

          <br><br>  I am starting to save all that data in a Airtable file and would like to create an easy app so each time I (or others) use slow cooking techniques instead of electric hob or oven I can record it and later create data visualization of how we collectively contribute to use less energy.

        <h3>designing with others - the rooftop project (starting)</h3>

                        With a few people from the MDEF class, as a lot of our experimentations have to take place outside and involve a sense of community, we decided to work together and would like to develop some of these projects on IAAC rooftop (dehydrator, compost station, furniture from redesigned trash, solar ovens...). We thought it would be great to work all together to give consistency to it instead of having a lot of unrelated projects.

                        We are a lot of students in IAAC but we have never had the occasion to work together so this could become a collaborative project open to other IAAC student from this year and the following years. To make this possible we would document all the process and organize how everyone can contribute and take care of the space.

                        <br><br>Right now we are at the step of checking with IAAC administration if this is possible.
