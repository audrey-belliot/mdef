          <h3>week reflections</h3>
          <strong>current documentation process</strong>
          <br>I usually have many different modes of documenting : including handwritten notes, pictures, videos, notes on Notion, lists of books to read, people to meet, things to experiment or to prototype, ideas added to my design space... I sometimes use Notion to create mini-websites for specific projects when they are supposed to be shared with other people. I would say that my main concern is the consistency of all these different medium, I feel like it is not always easy to go back to it after some time.

          <br><br><strong>what I would like to add to my process</strong>
          <br>For consitency, I think I need to force myself to dedicate some time more frequently to documentation so it can be split in small amount of time everyday instead of having to spend entire days organizing weeks of disorganized content.
                    Concerning the medium, I would like to take time to use drawing more, a way to do it could be to set myself some kind of challenge to make at least on drawing everyday of something that inspired me (in class or in any other context).
                    I would also like to find a way to make this documentation process more interactive to be able to co-create documentation with others or receive feedback. For this, we used HackMD during the first part of the seminar about Measuring the world and I think it could be a tool I could use more.

          <br><strong>documenting Tech Beyond the Myth</strong>

          <br>For this video exercice, I used video shots of a few seconds to retrace the steps of the two seminars "Measuring the world" and "The Almost Useless Machine". Some bits of the video include also "micro interviews" of classmates explaining what we are doing.
          The editing takes some time but it is a time I don't usually take and having a final result even of short 1 min video makes a great documentation to capture the emotions and energy during the process.
